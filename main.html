  <p>A flower, also known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants (plants of the
    division Angiospermae). Flowers consist of a combination of vegetative organs – sepals that enclose and protect the
    developing flower, petals that attract pollinators, and reproductive organs that produce gametophytes, which in
    flowering plants produce gametes. The male gametophytes, which produce sperm, are enclosed within pollen grains
    produced in the anthers. The female gametophytes are contained within the ovules produced in the carpels.</p>

    <p>A rose is either a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus Rosa (/ˈroʊzə/),[4] in the family Rosaceae
      (/roʊˈzeɪsiːˌiː/),[4] or the flower it bears. There are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of
      cultivars.[5]They form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs, climbing, or trailing, with stems that are often
      armed with sharp prickles.[6] Their flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy, in colours
      ranging from white through yellows and reds.</p></div>
